# GLEAM
Gleam is a friendly language for building type-safe systems that scale
* This is a git hub repo where you can learn the basics of the language in which I will try my level best to explain it
* For the installation guide follow the offical page here is the link
url-https://gleam.run/getting-started/installing/

After installation open your terminal or command promt and type 
gleam --version
 
* If you "gleam version" that means you have succesfully installed gleam

First lets create a project in order to create a new project we have command "gleam new project-name".

For example -> let me consider the name hello just use the command "gleam new hello"

Inside that directory another directory will be created change your directory and then open your favourite code editor 



* gleam.toml file contains the configuration for the project.
* src/ contains the program source.
* test/ contains additional code for testing the project.
